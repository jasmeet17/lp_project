This project contains the code implementation of the Primal Simplex, Dual Simplex method, Criss Cross Method for linear programming.
The code not only solves the Linear problem, but also generates PDF files using latex for all the steps involved in solving Primal simplex and Dual Simplex method. This code also handles the initial primal infeasible problem using Dual Phase 1.

Primal, Dual and Phase 1 Solver are in the file ques_1.py. Input to the code is three files:
1. Matrice A
2. Vector C
3. Vector B
as command line areguments. Please check the csv folders for the sample matrices and vectors.

The project also has 8 test cases, written inside the test.py
